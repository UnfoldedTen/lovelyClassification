coding_rules:
  complete_thought_rule:
    description: |
      One unit of behavior is defined by a complete thought. Sentence fragments without independent meaning are combined with later completions if uninterrupted.
    examples:
      - utterance: "This is a... [pause] cat."
        outcome: "Single verbalization."

  two_second_rule:
    description: |
      When unclear if verbalizations constitute separate thoughts, pauses of two or more seconds result in separate verbalizations.
    examples:
      - utterance: "Put the green block here. [3 sec pause] And the red one here."
        outcome: "Two verbalizations."

  superfluous_phrases_rule:
    description: |
      Superfluous introductory phrases ("I see," "Well," "Now," "I said,") are ignored and not coded separately.
    examples:
      - utterance: "Well, that's a nice picture."
        outcome: "Intro phrase ignored."

  yes_no_rule:
    description: |
      "Yes," "No," and close synonyms ("yeah," "nope") are coded independently from subsequent verbalizations.
    examples:
      - utterance: "Yes, it is big."
        outcome: "Two separate codes (Yes coded independently)."

  distributive_rule:
    description: |
      Verb clauses joined by "and" or "but" are coded separately unless a clear 2-second pause indicates a new verbalization.
    examples:
      - utterance: "Can you pick up the toy and put it away?"
        outcome: "Two separate verbalizations."

  compound_sentences_rule:
    description: |
      Independent clauses joined by "and," "but," "so," or "because" are coded separately.
    examples:
      - utterance: "Sit here, and draw a picture."
        outcome: "Two separate verbalizations."

  multiple_consecutive_verbalizations_rule:
    description: |
      Interrupted verbalizations completed after interruptions are coded separately if self-interrupted, otherwise based on content continuity.
    examples:
      - utterance: "You're building... [parent interrupts with unrelated comment]...a tower."
        outcome: "Coded based on interruption nature."
